# Estimating-Carbon-Emission-by-Vehicles-Volume-using-DataAnalysis-and-Machine-learning
Predict the carbon emission not directly from the variable of carbon emission, instead using Volume of Vehicles.

## Data Analysis Part
Initially find the summary statistics and visualization of data set.
Second, in data analysis part road, section start, section end and suburb are grouped together to find which is the high crowded area caused by high carbon Emission by Vehicles (most probably). 

## Machine Learning part
After the understanding of data insights, volume per day of dataset is considered as the dependent variable. Dependent variable is correlated with the vehicles_1, vehicles_2 and 85th_percentile_speed (weakly correlated).

Finally Support vector regression fitted on the dataset for prediction and evaluation.
